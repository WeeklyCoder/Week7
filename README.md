# Week7 | Modest Dictionary
Let's make a simple dictionary to base future projects on.

## üìÉ Description:
Stepping back from last week's seemingly daunting game, let's break it down and make a simple dictionary that accepts a WORD to lookup (through a simple input dialog box) and print out the MEANING on the console.

## üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Rules:
Input a WORD to lookup -> Output MEANING of the WORD. 

## ‚ú® Variation:
- Though you may use a simple input dialog box to get this done, get creative and see how you could integrate text, font, color, and visual element rendering on your screen.
